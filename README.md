First game using Phyton.
Game description and how to play.

This is my first game creation using the Python language. The game is a multiple-choice questionnaire that welcomes you as soon as you start playing. 
It follows a specific pathway, beginning with a simple question: "What is your name?" This is followed by an age verification question, which determines whether you are old enough to play. 
If you are, you can continue with the game.
You start the game with 10 health points, and the following questions will determine your fate. The first question asks you to choose between left or right, while the second question presents you with a lake and asks whether you want to swim across or go around it. 
Your choices will determine the outcome of the game, and you can either win or lose health points depending on your decisions.
The game follows this logic throughout, and it is up to you to make the right choices and come out victorious. 
I hope you enjoy playing this game and have fun exploring the different outcomes.
